        <p className="text-textDim leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Preparing an FCC engineering exhibit normally means juggling curve tables,
          terrain data, and spacing rules across several disconnected tools — or paying
          a consulting engineer to assemble it all by hand. Genoa brings the whole study
          into a single workflow.
        </p>
        <p className="text-cream font-semibold mb-4">It helps stations and engineers:</p>

          'Flag conflicts early — and surface an advisory path back to compliance — before filing',

        <p className="text-textDim leading-relaxed">
          FCC engineering is slow, expensive, and unforgiving — one bad contour or a
          missed spacing conflict can sink a filing or stall a station for months.
          Genoa lets you get to a defensible answer in minutes, with traceable,
          self-checked results — so the time goes into making decisions instead of
          wrangling data.
