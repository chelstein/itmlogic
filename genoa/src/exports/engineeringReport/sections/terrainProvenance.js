// Terrain provenance section.

// Dedicated section that consolidates everything an FCC reviewer would
// want to know about the DEM source and HAAT methodology behind the
// per-radial heights used in §73.313 / §73.333 calculations.  H&D-style
// exhibits ALWAYS state DEM source, dataset version, sampling method,
// radial spacing, and fetch timestamp — without it the contour
// distances are unverifiable.  The data is already attached to
// exhibit.evidence.terrain at compute time; this section just typesets
// it as a numbered exhibit (Roman) instead of letting it sit only in
// the JSON dump.
